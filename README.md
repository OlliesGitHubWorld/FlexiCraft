# üìñ Installation Instructions

Here's how to install FlexiCraft! üòÅ

These instructions are akin to most other plugins - remember to download any dependencies.

- Download [`FlexiCraft`](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/flexicraft.111090/).

- Copy the downloaded file(s) into your server's `plugins/` directory.
- If your server is running, shut it down using the `/stop` command.
- Start your server. This allows FlexiCraft to generate its default configuration files.
  - Feel free to edit these configuration files in the `plugins/FlexiCraft/` directory to your liking.
  - If you make any edits, save the file(s) and run `/reload` (or restart your server) to apply the changes.
- All done! We hope you enjoy FlexiCraft! :)

# ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Updating FlexiCraft

## üîé How do I check for updates?

We recommend checking the Spigot page at least once a week for any updates and announcements, unless you have a Spigot account which is 'watching' the resource (it's a link below the download button; it is enabled automatically when you download any plugin).

If you do not update FlexiCraft, then as with all software, you will miss out on new features, improvements and bug fixes. In addition, no support is provided to users who choose to use an outdated version. If you have any concerns about updating, please contact our support staff and we will listen to your concerns and advise you accordingly.

## üìñ How do I update FlexiCraft?

> ### Notice: *Before* you update!
> **Read most of the changelog.** Non-patch updates will almost certainly have important information that you need to understand prior to downloading and installing the updated version. 

> ### Notice: Automatic config migration
> Unless clearly clarified in the changelog of a particular version, FlexiCraft will automatically make any edits to your configuration to ensure it works with the updated version. Regardless, we rarely make changes to the configuration.

Updating FlexiCraft is identical to updating any other plugin on the platform. Remove the old version, pop in the new, restart. üòâ

- Download the latest version of [`FlexiCraft`](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/flexicraft.111090/).
- If your server is running, shut it down using the `/stop` command.
- Delete the existing `.jar` file for FlexiCraft in your server's `plugins/` directory.
  - This file is named in a similar format to `FlexiCraft.jar`, **ending with `.jar`**.
  - Do not delete the `plugins/FlexiCraft/` directory, unless you want to reset your configuration entirely.
- Copy the downloaded file(s) into your server's `plugins/` directory.
- Start your server.
- You have now updated FlexiCraft! :)
